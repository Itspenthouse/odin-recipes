    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests. Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must! Serve over hot cooked white rice.<br></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces.</li>

        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        
        <li>1 cup margarine</li>
        
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves<br></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. </li>
        <li>Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. </li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. </li>
        <li>Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough</Li> 
    </ol>
